# Popular Dog Breeds
Hello! Please enjoy exploring the many dogs provided by [The Dog API](https://www.thedogapi.com/)!
## Setup
Replace **dog-api-key** with the API key you received from me. Then, in the home directory, run 
```sh
npm install
```
Then 
```sh
cd frontend_vite
npm run dev
```
And in a separate terminal
```sh
cd backend
node app.js
```
Then click [here](http://localhost:5173/) and hopefully you see a cute page with a dog background :)
